What is MRI? Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, is a noninvasive medical imaging test that produces detailed images of almost every internal structure in the human body, including the organs, bones, muscles and blood vessels.

 MRI scanners create images of the body using a large magnet and radio waves.
